# Asset-Management-Tracker
In Progress - An Asset Management web application to keep track of employees' technical hardware equipment, software licenses and accounts.

## Motivation
The idea behind the creation of this project was to solve a problem I've had for a while at my current employer. Working as the sole IT professional at my company, I needed a central location to keep track of an employees technical assets, such as laptop information, accounts and licenses and any other technical asset or info. Current method to find these information are spread out through various different applications and files.
